This is a game to play the Farmer's Puzzle.
A farmer must take his fox, chicken and sack of grain across the wide river.
The trouble is, his boat is old and leaky, and he can only take one across with him at a time.
If he leaves the fox with the chicken, the chicken will be eaten.
If he leaves the chicken with the grain, the chicken will eat the grain.
