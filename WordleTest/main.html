        Put here an input box for the 5-letter word pattern you want to match.
        Use the . (dot) character for unknown letters.
        For example "a...e" will match all words that have 5 letters and the first letter is "a" and the last letter is "e".
        Add a submit button to send the pattern to the server and get the matching words.
